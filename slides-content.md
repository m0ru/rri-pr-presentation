# Review InvID

---

## Structure

- Overall Impressions
- Our suggestions
- RRI aspects

---

## Overall impression

- good idea - InvID would be very convenient
- unclear features
- technical details are well described
- assumes a high level of reader familiarity with the topic
- extensive budget plan

Note:

- we like the idea, good document structure
- convenience is definitely a pro, as is the ecological impact
- unclear what exactly the goals are -> see contradictions
- grammar/spelling issues (we have some tool recommendations)
- acronyms etc. are not explained (this is better in the presentation)
- plan for ad and infrastructure costs

---

## Agree on a detailed concept beforehand

Note:

- was clearly written by several people - document contradicts itself
- example: coop with banks & corporations
- example: being disruptive vs. using existing technologies

---

## Provide Sources for Claims

Note:

- InvID seems dependent on a few unsourced claims
- Improvment: add more references
- e.g. the availability and adoption of card-less payments

---

## Detail advantages over other solutions

Note:

- unclear how smartphones don't completely replace InvID
- if an app is needed - why don't just use the app?

---

## Focus clarity over statements that sound good

Note:

- example: being disruptive
- example: privacy as a feature
- no intrusion of company/bank interests - leads to other issues

---

## Think about different risks

Note:

- very good: risk section was included, failing as a product was accounted for
- but what if there's not enough money?
- in what ways can InvID fail a customer? e.g. dead battery
- APIs from banks etc. needed

---

## RRI Dimensions

Note: 

beyond what was already mentioned; rri-toolkit

- Ethics
  - [x] peer-review 
  - [ ] maybe mention code or do participative design
- Gender Equality
  - address this (e.g. company policy, eval how InvID affects ppl in this regard)
- Governance
  - address this
  - updates possible? who governs them?
  - coop with legislators?
- Open Access
  - address this
  - open source and hardware? (vs business-model?)
- Public Engagement
  - [x] talks about talking to banks/companies but also staying independent
  - [ ] engaging/including potential users of diverse backgrounds.
- Science Education
  - address how communication of results happens
